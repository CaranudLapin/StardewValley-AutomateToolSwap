This mod selects the correct tool for you whenever you click something that requires a tool.
Works with gamepad.

How it works: Just left click whatever you want and it will select the correct tool for it, the action will be performed at the same time as your click, like you were holding that tool from the beggining, if no tool is found nothing happens. The tools dont need to be on your hotbar, if it is in your inventory, it will work.

Things that the mod recognizes:
-Any Stone swaps to Pickaxe
-Any Wood swaps to Axe
-Weeds(Fiber) swaps to Scythe or MeleeWeapons,
-Crops that need Scythe to harvest swaps to Scythe
-Giant Crops swaps to  Axe
-Wilted crops swaps to Pickaxe
-Dry empty soil swaps to Hoe
-Dry soil with crop swaps to Watering Can
-Monsters swaps to MeleeWeapons
-Close to water swaps to Fishing Rod
-Well  swaps to Watering Can
-Dig spots swaps to Hoe
-Feeding benches in Barns and Coops swaps to Hay
-Goats and Cows swaps to Milk Pail
-Rabbits and Sheep swaps to Shears


Mod Config Options: (You can change it with the GenericModConfigMenu or manually in the config.json file)

-"Prioritize Pickaxes Over WaterCan" - true/false (If true, when you are holding a pickaxe and use it on a dry planted soil, the mod wont swap for WaterCan)
