This mod selects the correct tool for you whenever you click something that requires a tool.
Works with gamepad.

How it works: Just left click whatever you want and it will select the correct tool for it, the action will be performed at the same time as your click, like you were holding that tool from the beggining, if no tool is found nothing happens. 
The tools dont need to be on your hotbar, if it is in your inventory, it will work.
