This mod selects the correct tool for you whenever you click something breakable.
I just started playing the game and wanted a mod like this but i didnt found any, so i made it.

At the moment the only objects that triggers this mod are trees, logs, stumps, wigs, stones, large stones and fences.
As i said, i just started playing the game so it might have some objects i havent seen yet, like some large stones from the cave at deeper levels or items that i havent unlocked yet.

The tools that is swaps to are the axe, pickaxe, scythe and weapons, altough the weapons only are swapped for weeds, i will make it swap for monsters later.
If you there is a object that the mod doesnt detect please tell me and  i will try to make it work, if it is a stone from the cave tell me in what level it is
